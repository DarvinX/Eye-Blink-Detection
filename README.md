# Eye-Blink-Detection
Javascript project to detect eye blink from video feed.

In this branch I tried to implement machine learning(haarcascade in opencv.js). This was not feasible as mobile devices struggled to handle that much to processing. Not able to get enough FPS on lower end devices defeats the actual goal of this project.


I'll come back to this branch with some small CNNs and tfjs.
